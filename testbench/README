1) make 
		This will create all the program necessary to run the tests.
		This includes:
		kiss_fft -- a third party fft implementation to be used as a baseline.
		gen_samples -- a program used to create all the input samples. 
		rms_test -- program used to calculate the root-mean-squared error of the output		

2) generate.sh
		A script which calls the gen_samples program in order to generate all the input samples.
		The input data is placed into to directories "forward_data" and "sample_data"

3) Copy the fft program to test into the directory
		If built using the make command in the parent directory.
		The program should be called "noin".
		You can name it whatever you want, just be sure to set the appropriate
		variables in the test scripts ( e.g test.sh)

4) test.sh > rs.test
		Run the test.sh script.
		This script will run the fft program through all the input generated by
		the generate.sh script. The raw output of the fft program will be stored
		in the "results" directory.
		The rms_test program is run against the output and compares it against
		the baseline values, it will then output to stdout the root-mean-square 
		of the comparison.

5) View the results of the test in rs.test.
		This is a manual step, and we check to make sure that the
		root-mean-square error is within "acceptable" ranges.

		The format of the rs.test file:		
		RMS forward fft on "n" forward data
		re_sin
		real rms=0.000000000000000
		re_im_sin
		real rms=0.000000000000000

		RMS inverse fft on "n" sample_data

		re_im_sin
		real rms=0.00000003861156288826
